# Jimmy Script

## Purpose

I always wanted to create my very own programming language. 
My exploration of interpreter began when I was 15. 
At that time, I built an interpreter using recursion and built-in string methods in the BASIC language to evaluate expressions entered by the users.
However, I never had a chance to design a laxer and add the functionalities allowing users to write script files (e.g. adding if statements and for loops).

It has been almost 5 years since when I created the simple interpreter.
Over the years, I find myself berried in piles and piles of [CRUD applications](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete).
For example, in the year 2020, I made at least 3000 commits to some kind of [CRUD application](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete), as it is the most common thing that all of us face at work.
I think it's' the time for me to get out of that pile for just a little bit.

As my responsibilities grow, I realize that I begin to have less and less time to learn and explore the things that I always wanted to learn.
I don't like this trend, so I joined UofT Hacks to get mentor support and motivate myself to complete this ambitious project.
I want to thank all people that I met during UofT Hacks, and particularly their welcoming attitude and amazing suggestions.

The purpose of this project is to learn and build my own laxer to evaluate expressions, finding a good enough approach to run script files provided by the users of my language, and ultimately make JimmyScript [Turing Complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness).
Due to the lack of time in the hackathon, I'm not planning to write my own compiler, and I would build an interpreter on top of the Python language.
But the concept should be the same if I were to build this on top of any other programming languages.

This project is created solely for learning purposes.
An anti-purpose for this project, for example, would be to create a programming language that is of high performance or is actually usable in some daily tasks.
